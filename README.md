# Cascode Amplifier and Current Mirror Design in 180 nm and 22 nm Technology Nodes

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design and simulation of a **Cascode Amplifier**, **Cascode Current Mirror**, and **Beta Multiplier** using two different technology nodes: **180 nm** and **22 nm**. The goal of this project is to analyze the effects of scaling down the technology node from 180 nm to 22 nm in terms of circuit performance.

### Circuits Designed
1. **Cascode Amplifier**:
   
2. **Cascode Current Mirror**:
   
3. **Beta Multiplier**:

### Tools Used
- **LTspice** for circuit design and simulation.

### Circuit Structure
- `180nm/`: Contains schematic for 180 nm designs.
